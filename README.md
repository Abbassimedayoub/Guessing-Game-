# Guessing Game in Python

## Description
This is a simple guessing game implemented in Python. The game randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player has to guess the number. After each guess, the game provides feedback whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct. The goal is to guess the number with the fewest attempts.

## Features
- Random number generation
- User input for guessing
- Feedback on guesses (too high, too low, correct)
- Keep track of the number of attempts
- Option to play again

## How to Play
1. Run the `guessing_game.py` script using Python.
    ```bash
    python guessing_game.py
    ```
2. The game will prompt you to enter the range within which the random number will be generated (e.g., 1 to 100).
3. Once the range is set, the game will randomly select a number within that range.
4. You will be prompted to guess the number.
5. Enter your guess.
6. The game will provide feedback on whether your guess was too high, too low, or correct.
7. Keep guessing until you guess the number correctly.
8. After you guess the correct number, the game will display the number of attempts you took.
9. You will have the option to play again or exit the game.
